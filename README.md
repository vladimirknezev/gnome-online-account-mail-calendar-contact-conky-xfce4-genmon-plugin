🚀 gnome-online-account-mail-calendar-conky
A Python script that fetches mail and calendar via GNOME Online Accounts for Conky, with built-in timeout protection against zombie processes.

🌟 Key Features
🛡️ Zombie Process Protection: Uses socket.setdefaulttimeout() to ensure the script terminates if the network hangs, preventing Conky from freezing or piling up background processes.

🔐 Secure Authentication: Utilizes GOA's OAuth2 tokens. No need to hardcode your passwords into the scripts.

⚡ Lightweight: Designed to run as a background hook for Conky with minimal resource usage.

📁 Scripts
mail.py: Fetches the latest unread emails from your connected Gmail or Outlook accounts.

calendar.py: Retrieves upcoming events from your synchronized Google or Microsoft calendars.
