# 🚀 gnome-online-account-mail-calendar-conky

**A Python script that fetches mail and calendar via GNOME Online Accounts for Conky, with built-in timeout protection against zombie processes.**

---

## 🌟 Key Features
* **🛡️ Zombie Process Protection:** Uses `socket.setdefaulttimeout()` to ensure the script terminates if the network hangs, preventing Conky from freezing or piling up background processes.
* **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Utilizes GOA's OAuth2 tokens. No need to hardcode your passwords into the scripts.
* **⚡ Lightweight:** Designed to run as a background hook for Conky with minimal resource usage.

## 📁 Scripts
1.  **`mail.py`**: Fetches the latest unread emails from your connected Gmail or Outlook accounts.
2.  **`email-to-password.py`**: (Alternative) Uses IMAP login with App Passwords. Use this for Yahoo, AOL, or providers that don't support GOA tokens.
3.  **`calendar.py`**: Retrieves upcoming events from your synchronized Google calendar.

---

## 🔑 Special Note for Yahoo/AOL Users (Added to Setup)
If you see an "Authentication Failed" or "Token Error" message for your account:

Use the email-to-password.py script.

Go to your provider's Account Security settings.

Select "Generate App Password".

Copy the 16-character code and paste it into the PASSWORD field in the script.

## 🛡️ Why it's Legal and Secure
Official Protocols: The scripts use standard IMAP and DBus interfaces provided by the OS and email providers.

Local Processing: Your credentials and emails never leave your computer; they are sent directly to the email server via SSL.

No Main Password: Using App Passwords ensures your primary account password remains private.
